\subsection*{Warning}

clibs is still experimental and mostly for personal use. The A\-P\-I may change without warning.

\subsection*{What is clibs anyway?}

{\bfseries clibs} are utility code (types, typedefs, macros, functions) used across C programs. They are self-\/contained and domain neutral, able to be applied to various situations.

\subsection*{System Requirements}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A C compiler that supports A\-N\-S\-I C
\item G\-N\-U Make (only for testing)
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries clibs} is written in A\-N\-S\-I C (C89). Nevertheless, We tested {\bfseries clibs} against C89, C99 and C11. Hence, you may use it for code in either classic C or modern C.

We compile and run {\bfseries clibs} with G\-C\-C, Clang, Visual C++ and Intel C++ Compiler.

We test {\bfseries clibs} against several Unix or Unix-\/like systems\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Ubuntu 18.\-04 L\-T\-S
\item Cent\-O\-S 8
\item open\-S\-U\-S\-E Leap 15.\-1
\item True\-O\-S, which is Free\-B\-S\-D compatible
\end{DoxyItemize}

It should work on other Unix or Unix-\/like systems as well.

In addition, we test {\bfseries clibs} on a Windows container provided by \href{https://www.appveyor.com/}{\tt App\-Veyor}. Hence, {\bfseries clibs} should work on Windows as well.

\subsection*{How to Use?}

The utilities in {\bfseries clibs} are self-\/contained, distributed as either single header or single header plus single source combo. Just copy what you need to your own C project.

test\-\_\-$\ast$.c are test programs. You don't need them to use {\bfseries clibs}.
