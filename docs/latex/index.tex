\subsection*{Warning}

D\+ON\textquotesingle{}T U\+SE IT IN P\+R\+O\+D\+U\+C\+T\+I\+ON E\+N\+V\+I\+R\+O\+N\+M\+E\+NT.

clibs is still experimental and for personal use only. The A\+PI may change without warning.

\subsection*{What is clibs anyway?}

{\bfseries clibs} are common utilities (types, macros, functions) used across C programs. They are mostly domain neutral, able to be applied to various situations.

\subsection*{System Requirements}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A C compiler that supports A\+N\+SI C
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries clibs} is written in A\+N\+SI C (C89). Nevertheless, We tested {\bfseries clibs} against C89, C99 and C11. Hence, you may use it for code in either A\+N\+SI C or modern C.

We tested {\bfseries clibs} against several Unix or Unix-\/like systems\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Ubuntu 18.\+04 L\+TS
\item Cent\+OS 8
\item open\+S\+U\+SE Leap 15.\+1
\item True\+OS, Free\+B\+SD compatible
\item Solaris 11
\end{DoxyItemize}

It should work on other Unix or Unix-\/like systems as well.

B\+TW, though we didn\textquotesingle{}t test {\bfseries clibs} against Windows, it should also work because {\bfseries clibs} is implemented in A\+N\+SI C.

\subsection*{How to Use?}

The libraries in {\bfseries clibs} are self-\/contained, distributed in either single header or single header plus single source combo. Just copy what you need to your own C project.

test\+\_\+$\ast$.c are test programs. You don\textquotesingle{}t need them to use {\bfseries clibs}.

\subsection*{Available Utilities\+:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{boolean_8h}{boolean.\+h}}\+: boolean type for C
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{cmath_8h}{cmath.\+h}}\+: basic math operations
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{cstring_8h}{cstring.\+h}} and {\itshape cstring.\+c}\+: utility functions for C strings (null-\/terminated {\ttfamily char} arrays)
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{platform_8h}{platform.\+h}}\+: platform-\/specific data
\item {\itshape \hyperlink{print_8h}{print.\+h}}\+: console printing related function-\/like macros
\end{DoxyItemize}
