\subsection*{Warning}

clibs is still experimental and for personal use only. The A\+PI may change without warning.

\subsection*{What is clibs anyway?}

{\bfseries clibs} are common utilities (types, typedefs, macros, functions) used across C programs. They are mostly domain neutral, able to be applied to various situations.

\subsection*{System Requirements}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A C compiler that supports A\+N\+SI C
\item G\+NU Make (only for testing)
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries clibs} is written in A\+N\+SI C (C89). Nevertheless, We tested {\bfseries clibs} against C89, C99 and C11. Hence, you may use it for code in either A\+N\+SI C or modern C.

We compile and run {\bfseries clibs} with G\+CC, Clang, Visual C++ and Intel C++ Compiler.

We test {\bfseries clibs} against several Unix or Unix-\/like systems\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Ubuntu 18.\+04 L\+TS
\item Cent\+OS 8
\item open\+S\+U\+SE Leap 15.\+1
\item True\+OS, which is Free\+B\+SD compatible
\end{DoxyItemize}

It should work on other Unix or Unix-\/like systems as well.

In addition, we test {\bfseries clibs} on a Windows container provided by \href{https://www.appveyor.com/}{\tt App\+Veyor}. Hence, {\bfseries clibs} should work on Windows as well.

\subsection*{How to Use?}

The libraries in {\bfseries clibs} are self-\/contained, distributed in either single header or single header plus single source combo. Just copy what you need to your own C project.

test\+\_\+$\ast$.c are test programs. You don\textquotesingle{}t need them to use {\bfseries clibs}.
