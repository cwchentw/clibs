## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

**clibs** is still experimental and primarily intended for personal use.  
The API may change without notice.

---

## ‚ùì What is clibs?

**clibs** is a collection of utility code (types, typedefs, macros, functions) used across C programs.  
It is self-contained and domain-neutral, designed to be applicable in various contexts.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements

- A C compiler that supports ANSI C
- GNU Make (for testing only)

**clibs** is written in ANSI C (C89). However, we have tested it with C89, C99, and C11.  
You can use it with either classic or modern C codebases.

We have successfully compiled and run **clibs** with:

- GCC
- Clang
- Visual C++
- Intel C++ Compiler

We also test **clibs** on the following Unix or Unix-like systems:

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Rocky Linux 8.5
- openSUSE Leap 15.3
- FreeBSD 13.0

It should also work on other Unix-like systems.

Additionally, we test **clibs** on Windows using [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/),  
so it should be compatible with Windows as well.

## üì¶ How to Use

The utilities in **clibs** are self-contained, provided either as:

- single-header files, or
- single-header + single-source file combos.

Just copy the components you need into your C project.

Files starting with `test_*.c` are for testing purposes and are **not required** for using **clibs**.
